              structure their ideas (in the head) and think of what to write about computers.
              In the second step, let your child note the ideas to form an outline, ensuring they cover all the points
              while composing the essay.
              They will form easy-to-read, short and simple sentences from the pointers in the third step.
              Encourage your child not to get too deep describing any single idea, and stick to the word limit.
